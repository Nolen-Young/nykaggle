This repository was created to hold code for kaggle projects that I am working on.
At this point I have never used Kaggle before, so for awhile I will be trying to figure
out my workflow for problems from this platform. All work in this repository is for my
own personal education and curiosity, and is not meant to be taken as a serious example
of my work.

Current Branch: titanic

This branch stores the code to my solution to the titanic kaggle problem. This problem
is meant to be the tutorial on how to use Kaggle, and I chose to do it because of that.
After this problem I hope that I will be able to move onto some more challenging projects.
