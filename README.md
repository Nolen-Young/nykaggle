--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This repository was created to hold code for kaggle projects that I am working on.
At this point I have never used Kaggle before, so for awhile I will be trying to figure
out my workflow for problems from this platform. All work in this repository is for my
own personal education and curiosity, and is not meant to be taken as a serious example
of my work.

Current Branch: Master

The master branch will remain empty except for this file. Each individual problem will have 
it's dedicated branch. Further information for each project, can be found in that branch's
README.md file.
